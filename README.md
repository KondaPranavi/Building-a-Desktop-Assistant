Title: Building a Desktop Assistant
Description:
This project is a desktop assistant that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to provide a hands-free and interactive experience for users. It allows users to perform various tasks such as getting the current time, opening websites, and opening files on their computer.


Features:
Speech recognition: The assistant can listen to user commands through a microphone and convert them into text.
Text-to-speech: The assistant can convert text into speech to provide responses and information to the user.
Time display: Users can ask the assistant for the current time and it will provide the time in a human-readable format.
Website opening: Users can ask the assistant to open a specific website, and it will automatically launch the default web browser and navigate to the requested URL.
File opening: Users can ask the assistant to open a file on their computer, and it will attempt to locate and open the file using the default program associated with its file type.

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies, such as the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries.
Run the main script to start the desktop assistant.
Speak commands to the assistant and it will respond accordingly.
